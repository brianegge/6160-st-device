# 6160 SmartThings Device Handler
This repository requires an Arduino running https://github.com/TomVickers/Arduino2keypad

This repository contains code to interface a 6160 alarm keypad with an SmartThings Smart Home Monitor.  If you are interested in using a 6160 alarm keypad (commonly found connected to a variety of Honeywell alarm systems like the Vista-20p), this code may be useful to you.

Without Tom Vickers Arduino2keypad project, this project would not be possible. His project does the work of interfacing with the non-standard 4800 baud keypad. Tom chose to write an entire security panel on his Raspberry Pi while this project simply aims to make the keypad accessabe from the SmartThings ecosystem.
